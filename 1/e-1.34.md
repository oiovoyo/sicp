Exercise 1.34: Suppose we define the procedure (define (f g) (g 2))
Then we have
(f square)
	4
(f (lambda (z) (\* z (+ z 1))))	
	6
What happens if we (perversely) ask the interpreter to eval- uate the combination (f f)? Explain.

(define (f f) (f 2))

f <= f 2
f <= f 2 2
...
it is a infinite recursive procedure
