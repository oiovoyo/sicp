Exercise 1.10.  The following procedure computes a mathematical function called Ackermann's function.

(define (A x y)
   (cond ((= y 0) 0)
	        ((= x 0) (* 2 y))
			        ((= y 1) 2)
					        (else (A (- x 1)
								                    (A x (- y 1))))))

	What are the values of the following expressions?

	(A 1 10)

	(A 2 4)

	(A 3 3)
